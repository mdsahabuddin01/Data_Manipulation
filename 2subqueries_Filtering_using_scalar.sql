/*
Subqueries are incredibly powerful for performing complex filters and transformations. You can filter data based on single,
scalar values using a subquery in ways you cannot by using WHERE statements or joins. Subqueries can also be used for more
advanced manipulation of your data set. You will likely encounter subqueries in any real-world setting that uses relational databases.

In this exercise, you will generate a list of matches where the total goals scored (for both teams in total) is more than 3
times the average for games in the matches_2013_2014 table, which includes all games played in the 2013/2014 season.

Instructions 1/2
Calculate triple the average home + away goals scored across all matches. This will become your subquery in the next step.
Note that this column does not have an alias, so it will be called ?column? in your results.


*/

-- Select the average of home + away goals, multiplied by 3
SELECT 
	3 * avg(home_goal + away_goal)
FROM matches_2013_2014;

-- Select the date, home goals, and away goals in the main query.
-- Filter the main query for matches where the total goals scored exceed the value in the subquery.

SELECT 
	-- Select the date, home goals, and away goals scored
    date,
	home_goal,
	away_goal
FROM  matches_2013_2014
-- Filter for matches where total goals exceeds 3x the average
WHERE (home_goal + away_goal) > 
       (SELECT 3 * AVG(home_goal + away_goal)
        FROM matches_2013_2014); 

/* Filtering using a subquery with a list
Your goal in this exercise is to generate a list of teams that never played a game in their home city. Using a subquery, 
you will generate a list of unique hometeam_ID values from the unfiltered match table to exclude in the team table's team_api_ID column.

In addition to filtering using a single-value (scalar) subquery, you can create a list of values in a subquery to filter data based on
a complex set of conditions. This type of subquery generates a one column reference list for the main query. As long as the values in 
your list match a column in your main query's table, you don't need to use a join -- even if the list is from a separate table.

Create a subquery in the WHERE clause that retrieves all unique hometeam_ID values from the match table.
Select the team_long_name and team_short_name from the team table. Exclude all values from the subquery in the main query. */



SELECT 
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
-- Exclude all values from the subquery
WHERE team_api_id NOT IN
     (SELECT DISTINCT hometeam_id FROM match);
/*
Filtering with more complex subquery conditions
In the previous exercise, you generated a list of teams that have no home matches listed in the soccer database using a subquery in WHERE. Let's do some further exploration in this database by creating a list of teams that scored 8 or more goals in a home match.

In order to do this, you will construct a subquery in the WHERE statement with its own filtering condition.

Instructions

Create a subquery in WHERE clause that retrieves all hometeam_ID values from match with a home_goal score greater than or equal to 8.
Select the team_long_name and team_short_name from the team table. Include all values from the subquery in the main query. */

SELECT
	-- Select the team long and short names
	team_long_name,
	team_short_name
FROM team
-- Filter for teams with 8 or more home goals
WHERE team_api_id IN
	  (SELECT hometeam_id 
       FROM match
       WHERE home_goal >= 8);
