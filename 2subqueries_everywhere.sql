/*ALL the subqueries EVERYWHERE
In soccer leagues, games are played at different stages. Winning teams progress from one stage to the next, until they reach the final stage. In each stage, the stakes become higher than the previous one. The match table includes data about the different stages that each match took place in.

In this lesson, you will build a final query across 3 exercises that will contain three subqueries -- one in the SELECT clause, one in the FROM clause, and one in the WHERE clause. In the final exercise, your query will extract data examining the average goals scored in each stage of a match. Does the average number of goals scored change as the stakes get higher from one stage to the next?

Instructions

Extract the average number of home and away team goals in two SELECT subqueries.
Calculate the average home and away goals for the specific stage in the main query.
Filter both subqueries and the main query so that only data from the 2012/2013 season is included.
Group the query by the m.stage column.*/
SELECT 
	-- Select the stage and average goals for each stage
	m.stage,
    ROUND(avg(m.home_goal + m.away_goal),2) AS avg_goals,
    -- Select the average overall goals for the 2012/2013 season
    ROUND((SELECT avg(home_goal + away_goal) 
           FROM match 
           WHERE season = '2012/2013'),2) AS overall
FROM match AS m
-- Filter for the 2012/2013 season
WHERE season = '2012/2013'
-- Group by stage
GROUP BY m.stage;
/*
Add a subquery in FROM
In the previous exercise, you created a data set listing the average home and away goals in each match stage of the 2012/2013 match season.

In this next step, you will turn the main query into a subquery to extract a list of stages where the average home goals in a stage is higher than the overall average for home goals in a match.

Instructions

Calculate the average home goals and average away goals from the match table for each stage in the FROM clause subquery.
Add a subquery to the WHERE clause that calculates the overall average home goals.
Filter the main query for stages where the average home goals is higher than the overall average.
Select the stage and avg_goals columns from the s subquery into the main query.

SELECT 
	-- Select the stage and average goals from the subquery

	s.avg_goals > (SELECT avg(home_goal + away_goal)

/*
Add a subquery in SELECT
In the previous exercise, you added a subquery to the FROM statement and selected the stages where the number of average goals in a stage exceeded the overall average number of goals in the 2012/2013 match season. In this final step, you will add a subquery in SELECT to compare the average number of goals scored in each stage to the total.

Instructions

Create a subquery in SELECT that yields the average goals scored in the 2012/2013 season. Name the new column overall_avg.
Create a subquery in FROM that calculates the average goals scored in each stage during the 2012/2013 season.
Filter the main query for stages where the average goals exceeds the overall average in 2012/2013.
